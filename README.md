# number_guessing_game
A simple console-based Number Guessing Game built using Java. The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player has 5 chances to guess it correctly. After each guess, the game gives hints like “too high” or “too low.” At the end, the player can choose to play again or exit.
